# intro_speech_understanding

This repository contains assignments for the KCGI graduate course
"Intro to Speech Understanding."  Recommended use:

1. Clone the course directory by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/jhasegaw/intro_speech_understanding
```

This will create the directory `intro_speech_understanding`, and will
fill it with all of the code and assignments that have been published so far.

1. Every week, before lecture, `cd` to the directory
`intro_speech_understanding`, and then do the following:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "adding my work"
git pull -no-ff -m "downloading this week's assignments"
```

The command `git add -A` creates a new local record of your work, and
`git commit -m "adding my work"` puts the local record into your local
history.  The command `git pull -no-ff -m "downloading this week's
assignments"`, then, downloads this week's assignments, and merges
them with your local history.
